1. Spin Wheel and Scoring System

The spin wheel must operate based on a predefined and transparent algorithm where users with lower points get higher priority, and the distribution of prizes must be fair and balanced.

Wheel Sections (Chance Levels):

    1000 Chance

    2000 Chance

    3000 Chance

    4000 Chance

    5000 Chance

    Bronze Chance (7000 Chance)

    Silver Chance (9000 Chance)

    Golden Chance (10,000 Chance)

Key Rules of the Algorithm:

    70% of the time → Prizes between 1000 to 5000 points

    25% of the time → Bronze or Silver Chance

    5% of the time → Golden Chance

    Each user can spin the wheel only twice per day

2. Input Keys and Scoring Method

First Input Key: Points

Users receive points based on their activities:

✅ Direct Financial Activities

    Purchase under 1 million Toman ➝ X points

    Purchase between 1–2 million Toman ➝ Y points

    Purchase over 2 million Toman ➝ Z points

✅ Non-Financial Activities

    Registering on the site ➝ Fixed points

    Referring friends (successful registration) ➝ Fixed points

    Completing profile and required data ➝ Fixed points

    Purchasing training courses ➝ Fixed points

    Completing student projects via the site ➝ Fixed points

    Booking career counseling ➝ Fixed points

📌 Scoring Rules and Limits
Each activity is rewarded only once per defined time window unless it results in a new financial transaction.

Second Input Key: Spin Chances

Users can convert points into spin attempts:

    10 points = 1 spin

    50 points = 6 spins (+20% bonus)

    100 points = 15 spins (+50% bonus)

Each spin generates a chance recorded in the user’s account.
A raffle code is assigned daily for every: ✅ 10,000 chances = 1 raffle code
✅ Plugin Tasks

    User Points Management

        Award points for defined activities

        Log activities and timestamps

        Ensure limits on scoring

    Spin Wheel Engine

        Spin based on weighted probability:

            70% low-tier

            25% mid-tier

            5% high-tier

        Enforce daily limit of 2 spins per user

    Convert Points to Spins

        Define conversion rates (10 ➝ 1, 50 ➝ 6, etc.)

        Apply bonuses accordingly

    Chance Logging & Raffle Code Assignment

        Log each spin’s result

        Assign raffle code per 10,000 chances

    Admin Panel

        View user points, spins, and raffle codes

        Manually add points/spins if needed
